PINOCCHIO
I'm living in my parent's house. I do nothing, I spent my time to travel with my family. I research and practice to free myself from suffering and help my family free from wrong thinking and negative communication habits which cause a lot of trauma. The rest of my time, I run an internship program to help young people, who have the suffering to find financial opportunities like me 5 years ago.
"Are you kidding?", said a random John Doe
Seriously, I invested 5 years of my life to have finanical freedom, and sacrify my happiness, my health, why should I keep working? I'm living my dream now.
